# Vigenere-Cipher-C-project
This C++ project implements encryption and decryption using Vigenère cipher and provides option to save the text in the file.
<h1>Vigenère Cipher Encryption and Decryption</h1>
<h3>Project Description</h3>
This C++ project implements a Vigenère cipher, allowing users to encrypt and decrypt strings. The program provides an interactive interface where users can enter text and a key to perform the encryption or decryption process. Additionally, the encrypted or decrypted text can be saved to a file for future reference.

<h3>Features</h3>
<b>Encryption:</b> Encrypts user-inputted text using the Vigenère cipher method.
<b>Decryption:/b> Decrypts Vigenère cipher text back to the original text.
<b>File Handling:/b> Saves encrypted or decrypted text to a file.
