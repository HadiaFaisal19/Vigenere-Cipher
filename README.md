# Vigenere Cipher C++ project
This C++ project implements a Vigenère cipher, allowing users to encrypt and decrypt strings. The program provides an interface where users can enter text and a key to perform the encryption or decryption process. Additionally, the encrypted text can be saved to a file.

<h3>Features</h3>
<b>Encryption:</b> Encrypts user-inputted text using the Vigenère cipher method.<br>
<b>Decryption:</b> Decrypts Vigenère cipher text back to the original text.<br>
<b>File Handling:</b> Saves encrypted or decrypted text to a file.
